# Best Buy Cloud-Native Application

## üõ† Application Architecture

This project is a cloud-native microservices-based application for Best Buy's online store. It follows the architecture of the Algonquin Pet Store (On Steroids), with the key difference that **Azure Service Bus** is used as a managed order queue instead of RabbitMQ.

## üöÄ Deployment Instructions

1. Ensure your Kubernetes cluster is running (e.g., Minikube, AKS).
2. Apply MongoDB StatefulSet:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f Deployment Files/mongodb-statefulset.yaml
   ```
3. Create Azure Service Bus secrets:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f Deployment Files/azure-sb-secret.yaml
   ```
4. Deploy all microservices:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f Deployment Files/order-service-deployment.yaml
   kubectl apply -f Deployment Files/makeline-service-deployment.yaml
   kubectl apply -f Deployment Files/product-service-deployment.yaml
   kubectl apply -f Deployment Files/store-front-deployment.yaml
   kubectl apply -f Deployment Files/store-admin-deployment.yaml
